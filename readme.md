Dearborn Mahara Theme
======================

The Dearborn Mahara theme is designed to match our Moodle theme. This is a clone of the default theme with very little changes other than some styling enhancements to better match our theme.  We muted most colors in order to draw attention to action links that the end user will need to click to do things with their portfolio.  [Dearborn Public Schools](http://dearbornschools.org) is a K-12 school distict in Dearborn, Michigan.
